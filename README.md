Hello there! I am  Smriti Jha, pursuing Betch Computer Science Enginnering from Vellore Institute of Technology(BHOPAL).
I love to do tech projects that is based upon WEB DEVELOPMENT , recently I completed the front end developement portion with it's basic and now started with the backend development portion.
I preferred to learn data structures in Java language, for me java is quite easy to do so I started with it's basic and still continuing with java programming.
Recently I learned about R programming that focus on analysing the data in statistical form and graphical representation that calculates the data smoothly and correctly.
